  caveats <<~EOS
    #{token} requires Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions.
    Grant both in System Settings > Privacy & Security after first launch.

    #{token} is not signed with an Apple Developer ID.
    The quarantine flag is removed automatically during install.
    If macOS still says the app is damaged, run:
      xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine #{appdir}/SuperOpt.app
